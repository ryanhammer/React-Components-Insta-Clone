# React-Components-Insta-Clone

## Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props

## Introduction

This project was part of the Lambda School curriculum and served as a learning tool for understanding React components as part of rendering a React app using JSX. The instructions were as follows:

- For this project, you'll be building a simple Instagram clone using React.
- There is a file provided called `dummy-data.js` that contains some mock data. Each object in the mock data represents a faux Instagram post.
- Your React application will receive faux post data and render each as a separate Instagram post.

## Technologies Used

- The app was built using React
- Styling came pre-completed using CSS files for each component
- No back end is used; fake user post data comes from a file of dummy data
